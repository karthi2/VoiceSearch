# VoiceSearch
Webpage with voice search interface

This project is created to learn using the flask framework for web apps deployment. To make it a bit more fun, I have added voice 
recognition interface using the open source annyang (https://www.talater.com/annyang/) javascript library.

Today, it only picks up what you speak and does a google search on it. I will add more features to this as and when time permits.
